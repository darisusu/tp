FITBOOK command reference
=========================

Command format conventions
--------------------------
• Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters you should replace with your own values.
• Items in square brackets [ ] are optional. Items followed by `…` can be repeated multiple times.
• Commands that update a trainee use the index shown in the currently displayed list. The first trainee has index 1.
• Prefixes (such as `n/` for name) label each parameter so you can provide them in any order.
